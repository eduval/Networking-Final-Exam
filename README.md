# Packet Tracer Dynamic Final Exam (Practice Release)

Welcome to the official repository for the released version of the **Networking Final Exam (Packet Tracer Wizard)**. This version is designed to help students continue practicing and reinforcing their knowledge of IPv4, IPv6, interface descriptions, and other core networking concepts.

## 🧠 Purpose

This Packet Tracer activity is a **dynamic version of the final exam** used in class. Every time you open the file, some requirements change—IP addressing, interface names, descriptions, and more. The **topology stays the same**, but you must adapt to new configurations.

## Description

This final exam assesses practical and theoretical skills in data communication and networking using a comprehensive lab scenario. Students are required to configure routers, switches, PCs, and servers based on detailed network requirements, including:

- **Device Configuration:** Hostnames, passwords, banners, domain name, and security settings  
- **IPv4/IPv6 Setup:** Addressing, routing (OSPFv3), DHCPv4/DHCPv6, SLAAC, and default route advertisement  
- **Router Features:** OSPF with custom Router IDs, SSH access, password encryption, passive interfaces  
- **Switch Configuration:** Port security, port negotiation, descriptions, SSH setup, and violation modes  
- **End Devices:** PCs using DHCP, DNS setup with Google DNS, and web servers with specific IP assignments  
- **Connectivity Testing:** Ensuring successful IPv4 communication between various devices and internet access

## 📂 Files Included

- `FinalExam_Practice_Locked.pka`  
  👉 This version does **not** show assessment feedback. Use it to challenge yourself and simulate a real exam experience.

- `FinalExam_Practice_Unlocked.pka`
